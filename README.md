# Timescale frontend interview assignment

There are two parts to this assignment which should take around an hour to complete.
The first part you will build out a travel blog profile page. The second part 
you will need to manipulate data in arrays and objects in javascript.

## Travel blog

You will need to style a basic profile page for a travel blog. You will need to code the HTML for the page
and style it. The page is using `create-react-app` to run and compile the page

### Setup
```
cd travel-blog
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Restriction

There are a few restrictions in how you should be building the page:

- Fonts and images are already imported for you
- When naming your classes, try to follow the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology
- Styling variables are found at the top of the scss file (/travel-blog/src/App.scss)
- Use css grid and flexbox to achieve the final layout
- A responsive version is encouraged but not required (If you do a responsive version, you can just hide the navigation
 to make it easier)


### Finished result

<img src="./images/final-image.png" alt="" />

## Javascript questions

There are 4 functions that you will need to complete to modify the super hero data provided in 
`javascript-questions/super-heroes.json`

### Setup

```
cd javascript-questions
yarn install
yarn test
```

### Finished result

All of the tests in the `/javascript-questions/test` directory should pass.
